                    <summary>What is OOH audience measurement?</summary>
                    <p>OOH audience measurement is the process of counting and analyzing the number of people who have the opportunity to see an out-of-home advertisement, such as a billboard, transit shelter, or digital screen. Data Jam provides real-time, privacy-compliant audience counting using our JamBox device, delivering actual footfall data rather than modeled estimates.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item animate-on-scroll">
                    <summary>How does the JamBox count OOH impressions?</summary>
                    <p>The JamBox detects mobile devices within up to 300 meters of your OOH asset (range varies by environment). Unlike camera-based systems, it counts anonymized device signals to measure foot traffic and audience exposure without collecting personal data. This supports GDPR compliance while delivering accurate, real-time impression counts.</p>
